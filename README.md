# 5-3-1-Boring-But-Big-template-tool
I was spending too much time everyday using a calculator to figure out the numbers for my lifts, so I used Excel to make a tool that would allow me to quickly figure out all my lifts for a three week period based on an e1rm (estimated 1 rep max.)

I also put the document on Google Drive for ease of use on mobile, and so that others could use it as a template as well: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18teoTi910EN03K0Mh-yhxgko7SMppJRvkkkKHkayVuA/edit?usp=sharing
